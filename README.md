## Authentication

To authenticate requests, you must first create an account at the `/api/v1/account` endpoint. You can create as many accounts as you want to.

Authorization HTTP header example:
* `Authorization: Basic M3JkcGFydHlfY2xpZW50aWQ6amtmb3B3a21pZjkwZTB3b21rZXBvd2U5aXJram8zcDlta2Z3ZQ==`

Basic access authentication is used, with the user ID as the username and secret as the password. The header should be the string `Basic ` plus the Base64 encoded string {user_id}:{secret}.
It is very important to make sure there is no whitespace around or in the string that is being Base64 encoded. If in doubt, try to Base64 encode the sample values provided below and compare them to the results:
* Example user ID: `3rdparty_clientid`
* Example secret: `jkfopwkmif90e0womkepowe9irkjo3p9mkfwe`
* Concatenated to become: `3rdparty_clientid:jkfopwkmif90e0womkepowe9irkjo3p9mkfwe`
* Base64 encoded to: `M3JkcGFydHlfY2xpZW50aWQ6amtmb3B3a21pZjkwZTB3b21rZXBvd2U5aXJram8zcDlta2Z3ZQ==`
* Resulting in the Authorization header: `Basic M3JkcGFydHlfY2xpZW50aWQ6amtmb3B3a21pZjkwZTB3b21rZXBvd2U5aXJram8zcDlta2Z3ZQ==`

Endpoints which require authentication are marked as such in the description below.

If the authentication failed, the status code `401` will be returned.

## API

The api uses the `/api/vX` versioning schema where `X` is a number. New versions will be created for breaking changes. New endpoints, deprecations and removals will be announced/scheduled through the CHANGELOG.md file.
There is also a `X-STOCKS-DEPRECATION: Date` header which contains the date on which the endpoint will be removed.

All endpoints return json.

### GET /api/v1/isalive

Returns a 200 if alive.

### GET /api/v1/quote/{symbol}

Returns a quote for the given symbol if the according information could be retrieved. All stocks from https://iextrading.com/apps/stocks are supported, feel free to use their API for your purposes.

    "latestPrice": 187.59
