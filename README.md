## Authentication

The endpoints `/api/v1/isalive`, `/api/v1/quote` and `/api/v1/account` are not secured. All others require the userId in the path, as well as the secret via the Authorization header.

Example:
`Authorization: Secret as9-8dn8g08basnfd-asgdfsdfihsdf`

If the authentication failed, the status code `401` will be returned with an appropriate error message.

## API

The api uses the `/api/vX` versioning schema where `X` is a number. New endpoints, deprecations and removals will be announced/scheduled through the CHANGELOG.md file.
There is also a `X-STOCKS-DEPRECATION: Date` header which contains the date on which the endpoint will be removed.

All endpoints return json.
